The `main.ipynb` notebook is performing a grid search to find the best hyperparameters for a Random Forest classifier. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Define parameters grid for Random Forest:** A dictionary `param_grid` is defined with possible values for the hyperparameters `min_samples_split`, `min_samples_leaf`, and `n_estimators`. These hyperparameters control the behavior of the Random Forest classifier.

2. **Initialize Random Forest classifier:** A `RandomForestClassifier` object `rf_classifier` is created with `n_jobs=20`, which means that the classifier will use 20 CPU cores for parallel computation.

3. **Initialize Grid Search with 5-fold cross-validation:** A `GridSearchCV` object `grid_search` is created with the Random Forest classifier, the parameters grid, and a 3-fold cross-validation. The scoring metric is `f1_micro`, which is the F1 score computed globally by counting the total true positives, false negatives, and false positives. The `verbose=3` parameter means that the grid search will output detailed information about its progress.

4. **Fit the grid search to the data:** The `grid_search` object is fitted to the data `X` and the target `y`. This will perform the grid search, which involves training a Random Forest classifier for each combination of hyperparameters in the grid and evaluating its performance using 3-fold cross-validation.

5. **Print the best parameters found:** The best combination of hyperparameters found by the grid search is printed.

6. **Print the best mean cross-validated score found:** The mean cross-validated score of the best estimator found by the grid search is printed. This is the average F1 score over the 3 folds of the cross-validation for the best estimator.

7. **Write the best parameters and score to a log file:** The best parameters and score are written to a log file `logs/logs.txt`. This is useful for keeping a record of the results of the grid search.
